# Prelude in C

This is "Prelude in C" by Bach, in JavaScript.

It is mapped using notes on a scale, and notes on scales derived from the main scale. This allows
the song to be played in other modes, such as the minor key.

I haven't finished mapping out the song yet, and there isn't a button to play the song in minor yet.
You need to adjust the code to do that for the time being.
